# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview

The **Credit Card Approval Prediction System** is a Machine Learning web application developed using **Python, Flask, and XGBoost**. It predicts whether a customer is eligible for a credit card based on financial and demographic information entered through a web interface.

The application uses a trained machine learning model to analyze customer details and instantly displays whether the credit card application is **Approved** or **Rejected**.
